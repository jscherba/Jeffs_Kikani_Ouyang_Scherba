<u>Commitment Statement<u>: 
We are committed to investigating a scientifically interesting question through our group work in this class, supported by a dedication to mutual respect, transparent and open communication, and a spirit of rigor, curiosity, and integrity.

<u>Methods for conflict resolution<u>: 
If there is a concern about assigned tasks that are not done, we can plan on a 5pm check-in the day prior to the deadline.
If there is concern about work division between the auditing/for-credit students, communication will be made shortly after task assignments are made.
We enter into this group project with a mentality of humility, open to good-faith criticism from our group members.

<u>Regular Meetings and Check ins<u>: 
Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are generally reserved as open for group work. We will converse in class about meeting more or less frequently than weekly depending on the amount of work on the horizon. We will maintain internal group deadlines in advance of class deadllines to provide for buffer for timely project work completion. We will collaborate on any written work in Google Drive. 

<u>Communication, documenting, and sharing knowledge<u>: 
We will communicate primarily through our iMessage group chat. We will use Github for coding collaboration and version control.
